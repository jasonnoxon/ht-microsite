# SASS, NPM, and Gulp Workflow
A Workflow with NPM, SASS, Gulp, and more! Need to slim this down a bit, but a good start.

#Instructions
1. Clone this repo

2. Make sure the following are installed:
  - [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
  - [git](http://git-scm.com/)
  - [gulp](http://gulp.js)

3. Run 'npm install' to install project dependencies

Not super happy with 'mustache'...will use something else.
